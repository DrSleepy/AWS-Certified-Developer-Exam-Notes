# S3 - Data Consistency

**Read after Write Consistency**

Read after Write Consistency affects new file.
It means the file is immediately available after creating it.

S3 uses the PUT action to create a new file or update an existing file.
However, 'read after write consistency' only applies to NEW files created, not files being updated.
This means that any new file created will be immediately available to be read.

**Eventual Consistency**

Eventual Consistency affects updates and deletes.
It means the action (update / delete) will take some time for it to affect the file and is not performed immediately.

# S3 - Basics

1. Tiered Storage (i.e glacier)
2. Lifecycle Management (i.e delete files after 30 days)
3. Encrpytion
4. Subresources -
   4.1 Access Control Lists (ACL)
   4.2 Bucket Policies
   4.3 Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
   4.4 Transfer Acceleration

# S3 - Storage Classes / Tiers

Storage Classes (or Tiers) are different types of classes that may be assigned to a file.
If no storage classes is deteced during creating, the standard storage class will be used.

There are 5 different Storage classes

1. Standard -
   1.1 Used on files that are accessed on a daily bases
   1.2 99.99% availability (highest of all classes)
   1.3 99.99999999999% (11 x 9s) durability (highest of all classes)
2. Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) -
   2.1 Used on non-critical files that you may have backedup but still access on a daily bases
   2.2 Has 99.99% durability
   2.3 99.99% availability
   2.4 Used for thumbnails (whilst the actual images are stored using Standard class)
   2.5 No longer recommended by Amazon to use this class but rather the Standard class (which is now also more cost effective)
3. Infrequent Access (S3 IA) -
   3.1 Used on files that accessed every few months but still need them immediately when needed
   3.2 Lower feww than S3 Standard
   3.3 Charged whenever the files are accessed
4. One Zone Infrequent Access -
   4.1 Same as IA but data is stored in a single Availability Zone
   4.2 Still has 99.99999999999% (11 x 9s) durability
   4.3 Only has 99.5% availability, unlike Standard class
   4.4 Cost is 20% less than IA
5. Glacier -
   5.1 Used on files that never need to be accessed
   5.2 Accessing glacier files will require 3 to 5 hours before retrieval
   5.3 Used for old hospital records
   5.4 Is the cheapest of all classes

# S3 - Intelligent Tiering (new - released Nov 2018)

S3 Intelligent Tiering is a new storage class tier used for unknown or unpredictable access patterns.
This class will automatically move your data to the most cost-effective tier based class depending on how frequently you access each objest.

If an object is not used for 30 days, it will be moved to the infrequent Access tier
A small fee is included for this automation: \$0.0025 per 1,000 objects

It holds 2 tiers:

1. Frequent Access
2. Infrequent Access

Both Tiers Durability: 99.99999999999% (11 x 9s)
Both Tiers Availability 99.9%
